# Photo Tagger

An implementation of photo tagging in Rails and vanilla JavaScript.

Rails provides a RESTful CRUD API for users, photos, and tags. JavaScript front-end provides a familiar interface:
click on a photo, and a contextual menu withaa list of users appears. Selecting a user sends the tag with associated user
and location on photo to Rails for later retrieval and display.
